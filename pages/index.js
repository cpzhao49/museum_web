          The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City, colloquially `&quot;`the Met`&quot;`,[a] is the largest art museum in the Americas. Its permanent collection contains over two million
          works,[1] divided among 17 curatorial departments. The main building at 1000 Fifth Avenue, along the Museum Mile on the eastern edge of Central Park on Manhattan`&quot;`s Upper East Side, is
          by area one of the world`&quot;`s largest art museums. A much smaller second location, The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, contains an extensive collection of art,
          architecture, and artifacts from medieval Europe.
